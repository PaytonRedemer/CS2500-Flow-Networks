This file gives the input and output formats for the project.

The input file consists of a set of weighted arcs found in the network.  Each line of the input file consists of start vertex,end vertex,capacity (comma delimited with no spaces.)  The input ends when there are no more arcs.

The output may be sent to the screen and/or a text file.  If a text file is used, the title for input file network1.txt would be network1.out so that there is no question about what input file generated which output file.

The format must be as follows.
First line:  Your name.
The second line is the text "Input file:" followed by two spaces and the exact filename of the input.
The third line is a blank line followed by a line that reads "Input:".
The input is listed following this as an echo check.  Print each input line read on a line by itself exactly as read.
The input read and the generated output is separated by one blank line.

The start of the output is a line with the text "Network flow:".
Each arc and the final flow on that arc is then listed (in some reasonable order) as:  start vertex, space end vertex, tab "flow:" two spaces and finally the flow "/" capacity of the arc.

After all arcs have been listed, a blank line followed by the text "Max flow in this network is " and the integer max flow.

If a virtual vertex is generated by the program, it is listed either in the input section or between the input and output sections as "A virtual vertex <name> and two arcs <start,end,capacity>, <start,end,capacity> were generated to replace arc <start,end,capacity>."
While you may choose any naming schema you wish for virtual vertices, please be consistent.

For example (see the following lines)
a,b,12
a,c,9
A virtual vertex replace1 and two arcs <c,replace1,6>, <replace1,a,6> were generated to replace arc <c,a,6>.
b,c,9
A virtual vertex replace2 and two arcs <c,replace2,19>, <replace2,b,19> were generated to replace arc <c,b,19>.
d,g,45

or before the output:

A virtual vertex replace1 and two arcs <c,replace1,6>, <replace1,a,6> were generated to replace arc <c,a,6>.
A virtual vertex replace2 and two arcs <c,replace2,19>, <replace2,b,19> were generated to replace arc <c,b,19>.
